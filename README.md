- TOWER DEFENSE STRATEGY
***Scaffolding or Endgame Components:***
When you start a stage in VIM tower defense, you are faced with a challenge - a wave of enemies, each with different strengths and capabilities. You, as the player, have a limited number of towers you can "pre-pick " before a game to defend against those enemies. There are resources that allow you to build a tower, and there are a limited numher of squares that you can place them in. You must place them in a way that will allow you to defend against the wave. The more towers you have, the higher your score. Your goal is to survive as long as possible.

1. To defeat a level in VIM Tower Defense, there are a variety of ways and strategies that each work extraordinarily well, among many ways that don't work at all. These strategies include:
   - 1. A player can choose to power up their economy first with many neo-gathering towers and fewer defense towers; lay out the field with basic pea-shooter towers, save up to use more powerful towers that do massive damage; completely focus on explosive and traps; or use stinky roflcopters to herd all the enemies into one lane before wiping them all out with penetrating attacks.
   - 2. The process of being able to select many options, each with its unique stengths and weaknesses, and resulting in a variety of style and creativity-based strategies, is the core essence of the Tower Picker Technique.
   - 3. Avoid overpowered Towers, avoid useless towers, and avoid overpowered traps in the early phases.
   - 3. The most important thing to remember is that the more powerful a tower, the less you need to defend
2. Milestone Unlock
   - 1. When you complete each level, you will usually unlock a new Tower to help you defend against swarms of enemies. Not by coincidence, that new tower is often the exact tower that directly counters the toughest zigling swarm in the stage you just defeated, and would have made your life a lot easier if you had it earlier!
   
3. DO SOMEDAY/... Maybe
   1. Allow players to choose between
      a(playing_it_safe | small_reward)
      b(take_a_big_risk | try_for_big_reward)
   2. What are the towers the users can pick?
   3. How many different towers options will reshape the user immersion into new inspiring creative strategies.
